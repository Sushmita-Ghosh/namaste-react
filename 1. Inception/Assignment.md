### What is `Emmet`?

---

A: `Emmet` is the essential toolkit for web-developers. It allows you to `type shortcuts` that are then expanded into full pieces of code for writing `HTML` and `CSS`, based on an abbreviation structure most developers already use that expands into full-fledged HTML markup and CSS rules.

### Difference between a Library and Framework?

---

A: A `library` is a collection of packages that perform specific operations whereas a `framework` contains the basic flow and architecture of an application. The major difference between them is the complexity. Libraries contain a number of methods that a developer can just call whenever they write code. React js is library and Angular is Framework. The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required. If a library is used, the application calls the code from the library.

For example `React` can exist as a small part in your application along with other frameworks or stuff as it is just a library , there are no set of rules/ maintain a flow like `Angular`/`NextJs`

### What is CDN? Why do we use it?

- CDN stands for Content Delivery Network.
- The main purpose of a CDN is to deliver web content, such as images, videos, CSS files, JavaScript files, and other static assets, to end users more efficiently and quickly.
- When a user requests content from a website, the CDN serves the content from the server that is closest to the user's geographical location.

#### Key Reasons why CDNs are used:

- Improved Website Performance
- Cost Efficiency
- Faster Content Delivery
